"""
Collect sequential Big Five (BFI-50) + Political Compass responses
from an OpenAI chat model (openai==0.28, ChatCompletion API).

- Reads API key from env var: OPENAI_API_KEY
- Supports political-role conditioning (default / left-/right- authoritarian/libertarian)
- Normalizes outputs to canonical Likert options:
    * Big Five: 5-point (Strongly Disagree … Strongly Agree)  [Neutral allowed]
    * Compass : 4-point (Strongly Disagree … Strongly Agree)  [No Neutral]
- Saves ONE CSV with columns: X1..X112 (order-aware)

Usage:
    pip install openai==0.28 pandas
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
    python collect_bigfive_compass_responses.py
